      index [:brand, :name]
      
      delegate_to :find    
    end
  end
  
  Product.create :name => 'ipod', :brand => 'apple'
  
  Product.lookup(1) # cache_hit, 1 memcached query
  Product.lookup(2) # cache_miss, 1 memcached query, 1 db query: .find(2) (see delegates_to)
  Product.lookup_by_name('ipod') # cache_hit, 2 memcached queries
  Product.lookup_by_brand_and_name('apple','ipod') # cache_hit, 2 memcached queries
